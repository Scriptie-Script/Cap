            <li class="bit">9:20 - All captains are to be in their designated positions. Class 10 will be controlled by Bidushi, 9 by Anuska, 8 by Bishow, 7 by Bijay, 6 by Ayusha, 5 by Sneha, 4 by Sohan, 3 by Salami, 2 by Subash, 1 by Resa and BMW girl.

            <br>
            <li class="bit">(When the Anthem ends) - All captains are to abandon to their postions. Classes 1 - 5 are to be sent by nearby captains, the seniors move on their own. I need 5 captains to rush and form a line holder. This will be decided on the spot as some captains can be occupied by shitrats. So, 5 free captains need to position themselves near class LKG.</li>

Junior region will be controlled by Ayusha, Anuska, Sohan, Resa, Sujan and Milan while the senior region will be held by Bishow, Sneha, Bidushi, Bijay and Anuska. Distribution of the captains will depend on the situation so we need to be dynamic</li>
